Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid - like or beroid - like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid - like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous \u2013 Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians","5705edcd52bb8914006896ce":"the Tehachapi Mountains","56e089ab231d4119001ac289":"$200,000","5725c743ec44d21400f3d54a":"The European Commission","56f8a2969e9bad19000a022f":"Agricola","56bf49993aeaaa14008c95b8":"Stanford University","5726ae32708984140094cdad":"orphans","5726c4b5dd62a815002e8fda":"13th","5705fec152bb89140068977d":"property","5725d94bec44d21400f3d69e":"Apollo 1 backup crew","5726ee28708984140094d659":"Sir George Gilbert Scott","5729e500af94a219006aa6b7":"the Middle Miocene","5730ab63396df91900096261":"1000 CE","56f89a959b226e1400dd0ca1":"scrutiny","5733a6ac4776f41900660f58":"Warsaw","5725b9db38643c19005acbe1":"comb jellies","571cb27fdd7acb1400e4c134":"12 %","5727d3843acd2414000ded6b":"The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, The New York Times, and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows","5725d52f89a1e219009abf7a":"contrasts with another principal networking paradigm","57267f1cdd62a815002e8744":"Citadel Broadcasting","56e7770037bdd419002c3fe3":"Scotland","57281bbc2ca10214002d9dfb":"David Tennant","57296ab93f37b3190047836c":"via a D loop mechanism","5726dba1dd62a815002e92e8":"East Asian pottery and porcelain in the world","57297547af94a219006aa45f":"a number","57295a116aef051400154d44":"chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic","56be5523acb8001400a5032c":"May 21, 2013","57277944f1498d1400e8f90c":"Life","56dfb5777aa994140058e025":"Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing","57297725af94a219006aa49b":"Chloroplasts","5725f46289a1e219009ac0fa":"1946","572916f16aef051400154a59":"frontier market or occasionally an emerging","56bec38b3aeaaa14008c9398":"Death Wish Coffee","57296ab93f37b31900478369":"bacteriophage T4","5733140a4776f419006606e0":"1313","5727efabff5b5019007d98e3":"1963","572812e74b864d19001643d1":"pay","570967c4ed30961900e840bc":"Eutelsat's Eurobird 1","571c8198dd7acb1400e4c0d0":"gaseous","5725d662ec44d21400f3d687":"three","570603c475f01819005e7882":"2010","572882242ca10214002da424":"1273","57111713a58dae1900cd6c04":"E.I. du Pont","572a1a5c6aef051400155286":"the same reduction","5711648850c2381900b54ac4":"liquid phase","572972f46aef051400154ef2":"in most plants, chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves","572744aff1498d1400e8f58b":"2 metres","57097b50200fba1400368050":"36 %","5727ed2e3acd2414000df003":"will result in high wages","572fd47fa23a5019007fca55":"the Scottish Government","5706094b52bb8914006897de":"petroleum","570d2417fed7b91900d45c40":"Melbourne","57286d7d4b864d19001649e4":"Mike Nichols","56e1d9fee3433e14004231cc":"class of NP - complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP","572ff86004bcaa1900d76f67":"Islamisation of pan - Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on \"sharia","570d4606b3d812140066d619":"Victoria","57274d9bf1498d1400e8f5f6":"1957","57287fec4b864d1900164a3e":"Tibetan Buddhism","56d9b389dc89441400fdb6ed":"More than 1 million","5733f309d058e614000b6649":"British musket fire","56e11d8ecd28a01900c675f2":"84 hours","57281ab63acd2414000df495":"white flight","5727213c708984140094da38":"Satyagraha","5726e179dd62a815002e93af":"various disciplines of pharmacy","56de148dcffd8e1900b4b5bc":"Robert Guiscard","5727492f708984140094dbb6":"Laverne & Shirley","5729f4273f37b319004785fe":"Thomas Piketty","572ff5fcb2c2fd1400568657":"Rijn","56f827caa6d7ea1400e1743c":"requiring his arrest","572975073f37b31900478415":"use the potential energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy","57096f37200fba1400367fe8":"BSkyB does not carry any control over the channel's content","572a0b0b6aef0514001551f7":"MHC","5725d61038643c19005acdd3":"32","571cd88ddd7acb1400e4c18e":"exothermic reaction","5729f1fcaf94a219006aa6d7":"\u03b3\u03b4 T cells","57108c95b654c5140001f97b":"Huguenot Street Historic District","5726f36cdd62a815002e95fe":"cost - containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs","572831512ca10214002da04e":"executive producer","57264e2f708984140094c1e5":"the open - access scientific journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by a multinational team","56e7586d37bdd419002c3eb6":"US Supreme Court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the US Constitution","5705f36452bb891400689718":"regional tourism groups as consisting of northern, central, and southern California regions.

It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience.

I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong - doing. I feel I have done no wrong.

When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles. If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D - loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate. At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A - - > G gradients seen in plastomes.

Along with Erhart Hegenwalt's hymnic version of Psalm 51, Luther's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's catechism","57268885dd62a815002e886a":"approximately 6 miles","571cb010dd7acb1400e4c12b":"photosynthesis","5725e152271a42140099d2cd":"Apollo 5","5730b2ac2461fd1900a9cfb5":"unfermented grape juice","5728fd9b3f37b31900477f3d":"Duarte Barbosa","56d9b5ffdc89441400fdb720":"Business Connect","572a058aaf94a219006aa754":"CYP27B1","5729779b6aef051400154f62":"chloroplast formation","572951f16aef051400154cd0":"a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body","572681ab708984140094c85f":"1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS.

In fact, the Cobham \u2013 Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME - hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP - complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential - time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress.
